The most important thing to remember about your computer is that it is a stone.
With your guidance it can be a stepping stone -- a productivity tool, in current jargon.
Or it can be a weight around your neck that drags you under.
When all is said and done, computers are only stones.
If ever you find yourself thinking otherwise, stop...
  ...take a deep breath,
      ....toggle off the power,
              --and get a life.
